We will use hololens as our device and our interface will be the improved the operation 
system by importing its API extra and make additional applicaton to support our softwear 
and make sure every functions will be there and help the asturantant to do the mission
without interruption and enhance the spacesuit's refine like gesture helper to help
the asturant accomplish the eva task.1)Communication 2)Vita will works without the 
interruption of asturant's mission in the eva

For successful communication between an astronaut and ground control / a vehicle, all 
parties must take on a client / server role during communication. The astronaut will always act as a server
since he will be entering an exiting a vehicle for EVA purposes and all other parties will act as a client.

In order for an astronaut to communicate with an outside party he must receive and accept a request for communication.
In order to implement this protocol programmatically we will use the sockets library in conjunction with the 
select library using C#. This will allow for full duplex communication and will also allow for an astronaut to 
communicate with more than one client.
