We will use hololens as our interface and our interface will be the improved the operation 
system by importing its API extra and make additional applicaton to support our softwear 
and make sure every functions will be there and help the asturantant to do the mission
without interruption and enhance the spacesuit's refine like gesture helper to help
the asturant accomplish the eva task.

For our implementation we will use the hololens 1. We will create our environment by using the hololens API to modify the existing 
software which will allow us to create a more convincing simulation. We will also use the hololens API to assist with fine-tuning the astronauts gestures.

1)Communication 

For successful communication between an astronaut and ground control / a vehicle, all 
parties must take on a client / server role during communication.  
In order for a server to communicate with an outside party he must receive and accept a request for communication. 
Each acting party will be assigned a unique identifier, or â€˜channel which the distant end must know in order to request communication.  
When a party is not actively communicating with an individual, they will switch to a default mode server mode where they will constantly be 
listening for a communications request.  

In order to implement this protocol programmatically we will use the sockets library in conjunction with the select library using C#. 
This will allow for full duplex communication and will also allow for an astronaut to communicate with more than one client. 


2)Vita will works without the 
interruption of asturant's mission in the eva
